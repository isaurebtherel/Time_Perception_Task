# Time_Perception_Task
The goal of this experiment is to study how time perception changes when you are having fun (playing game) compared to when you are doing something tedious (studying). 
Task on time perception with a 'gaming block' and a 'study block'. During both blocks, participants will have to press a key when they believe one minute has passed.
